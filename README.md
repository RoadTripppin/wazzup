## Project Description
We have designed and developed a web-based WhatsApp Clone application called wazzup. The main goal of the application is to provide a platform for one-to-one communication among the users of the app. The application has a register function so that new users can join and a login function so that existing users can login and use the application. Passwords are encrypted using the JWT token. For each user, email ID is the primary key and is required to register and login to the application. The application provides users to do the following:
•	Search for a user
•	Get rooms with the users you have interacted
•	Update user
•	Get messages of a chat room
•	Private chat rooms
•	Create chat rooms
•	Send-messages

We have used Golang for backend, React for frontend and SQLlite as the storage database.
