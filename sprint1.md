- [x] Client project setup using create-react-app [#6](https://github.com/RoadTripppin/wazzup-client/issues/6)

- [x] Design Chat window/container component [#20](https://github.com/RoadTripppin/wazzup-client/issues/20)
- [x] We are using OpenAPI to descibe the APIs used by the client. It makes helps us to come up with a robust API specification [#14](https://github.com/RoadTripppin/wazzup-client/issues/14) [#15](https://github.com/RoadTripppin/wazzup-client/pull/15)

We extensively searched to find the right set of tools needed to this project 
- We are using [lodash](https://lodash.com/) because it is more powerful than standard ES6, in that it works on objects, has iteratee / predicate shorthands, lazy evaluation, guards against null parameter, and has **better performance**. 
- We are using cypress to do write client tests for the components we have written.
- Also to safeguard overselves against accidental merges into the main we add added [WIP pluggin](https://github.com/apps/wip) at the org level.

- [x] Bug issue for password login resolved [#20] (https://github.com/RoadTripppin/wazzup/issues/20)
- [x] We are using OpenAPI to descibe the APIs used by the client. It makes helps us to come up with a robust API specification [#14](https://github.com/RoadTripppin/wazzup-client/issues/14) [#15](https://github.com/RoadTripppin/wazzup-client/pull/15)

We extensively read about the use of:
